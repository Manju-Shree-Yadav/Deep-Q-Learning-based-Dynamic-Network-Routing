# Deep-Q-Learning-based-Dynamic-Network-Routing
# Problem Statement
Traditional network routing algorithms often fail to adapt dynamically to changing network conditions, leading to suboptimal performance in terms of latency, packet loss, and throughput. This project aims to develop a robust dynamic network routing algorithm using Deep Q-Learning (DQL) that can optimize these metrics and ensure efficient packet transfer even under varying network conditions.
