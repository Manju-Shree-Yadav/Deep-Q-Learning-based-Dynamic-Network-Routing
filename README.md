# Deep-Q-Learning-based-Dynamic-Network-Routing
# Problem Statement
Traditional network routing algorithms often fail to adapt dynamically to changing network conditions, leading to suboptimal performance in terms of latency, packet loss, and throughput. This project aims to develop a robust dynamic network routing algorithm using Deep Q-Learning (DQL) that can optimize these metrics and ensure efficient packet transfer even under varying network conditions.
### Literature Review
Dynamic routing algorithms have been extensively studied, with traditional methods including Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms. However, these methods lack the adaptability required for modern network environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically Deep Q-Learning, offers a promising approach to dynamically adjust routing decisions based on real-time network conditions, leveraging experience to optimize performance.
